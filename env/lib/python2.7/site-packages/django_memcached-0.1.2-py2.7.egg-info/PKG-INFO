Description: 
        django-memcached
        =================
        
        This is a very simple reusable app which does one thing: shows you statistics
        about your currently running memcached instances.  There are no database models
        and not much configuration.
        
        Installing django-memcached
        ----------------------------
        
        1. Either download the tarball and run ``python setup.py install``, or simply
           use easy install or pip like so ``easy_install django-memcached``.
        
        
        2. Add django_memcached to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting::
        
               INSTALLED_APPS = (
                   # ...
                   'django_memcached',
               )
        
        
        3. Add the urls to your url configuration::
        
               urlpatterns = patterns('',
                   # ...
                   (r'^cache/', include('django_memcached.urls')),
               )
        
        
        4. If you want to restrict these urls to only staff members, just add this
           setting to your settings file::
           
               DJANGO_MEMCACHED_REQUIRE_STAFF = True
        
        
        That's it.  Hopefully this app gives you a little insight into how your
        memcached servers are being utilized.
